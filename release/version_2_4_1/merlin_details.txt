TITLE: `MERLIN' : mixed effects regression for linear, non-linear and custom models

DESCRIPTION/AUTHOR: merlin fits linear, non-linear and user-defined mixed 
effects regression models. merlin can fit multivariate outcome models of any 
type, each of which could be repeatedly measured (longitudinal), with any 
number of levels, and with any number of random effects at each level. 
Standard distributions/models available include the Bernoulli, beta, gamma, 
Gaussian, linear quantile, negative binomial, ordinal, Poisson, and 
time-to-event/survival models include the exponential, gompertz, Weibull, 
Royston-Parmar, general log hazard and general log cumulative hazard models. 
Interval censoring and left truncation are supported for all survival models. 
merlin provides a flexible predictor syntax, allowing the user to define 
variables, random effects, spline and fractional polynomial functions, 
functions of other outcome models, and any interaction between each of them. 
Non-linear and time-dependent effects are seamlessly incorporated into the 
predictor. merlin allows level-specific random effect distributions, either 
multivariate normal or t, which are integrated out using either Gaussian 
quadrature or Monte-Carlo integration. See
