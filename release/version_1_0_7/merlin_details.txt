TITLE: `MERLIN' : mixed effects regression for linear and non-linear models

DESCRIPTION/AUTHOR: merlin fits linear, non-linear and user-defined mixed effects regression models. merlin can fit multivariate 
outcome models of any type, each of which could be repeatedly measured (longitudinal), with any number of levels, 
and with any number of random effects at each level. Standard distributions/models available include the Bernoulli, 
beta, gamma, Gaussian, linear quantile, negative binomial, ordinal, Poisson, and time-to-event/survival models include 
the exponential, gompertz, splines on the log hazard scale, Royston-Parmar, and Weibull. merlin provides a flexible predictor 
syntax, allowing the user to define variables, random effects, spline and fractional polynomial functions, functions of other 
outcome models, and any interaction between each of them. Non-linear and time-dependent effects are seamlessly 
incorporated into the predictor. merlin allows level-specific random effect distributions, either multivariate normal or t, which 
are integrated out using either Gaussian quadrature or Monte-Carlo integration. See https://www.mjcrowther.co.uk/software/merlin 
for detailed examples.
